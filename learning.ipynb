        "AI has become *the* conversation topic of these days. Sceptics see the doom of the world rising, visionaires see old dreams come true quicker than expected, and most agree on \"this will change everything\". \n",
        "\n",
        "Sure, it is nice to have images generated from prompts. I use this to revamp my old food blog with the ugly images. And surely it is interesting to have a conversation with ChatGPT about any topic you dare to ask. Even if we know that system is lying like a politician briefly before elections, it is also as charming and so we start dialogs about important and personal questions and begin to align with the answers given. \n",

        "I played around with ChatGPT and Midjourney (as advanced consumer) and Stable Diffusion (mostly following some youtube kids), learnt some of the buzz words (Model, inference, token, semantic vectors, etc.), tried (and succeeded with) some \"naive integration\" but the more I see, the more questions come up.\n",

        "\n",
        "If you have worked with Cloud providers, you know the setup of virtual machines. While for classic projects, a virtual machine is rather a convenience (quick setup, automated installation, secured environment etc.), it becomes a \"must\" for experiments with AI. Models, data, and processing needs grow so quick that maintaining your own setup is not feasible any longer - at least until you leave learning mode and decide to build your own AI factory ðŸ˜….\n",

        "Especially in the free environment, Colab has some performance and quality issues. You will learn pretty quick about broken tasks because your (virtual) hardware is not sufficient. So if you want to move to a more specialized provider, feel free to do so. I tried some few, but are not yet able to compare them systematically since I basically used only beginner's feature sets.\n",

        "It's great that ChatGPT can write now software code for you, but what do you do with it? Today's tool chain maturity still requires that you integrate partial results into an end-to-end workstream. So you should at least roughly know what you are doing with the individual components.\n",

        "For developers this might be familiar turf to some extent, so you can quickly flip through this block. For everyone else, this chapter is not necessarily a roadblock before you can jump into AI joys, but it can't hurt to make yourself familiar with these concepts before or in parallel to the AI learning, depending how you learn best.\n",

        "git is the central repository for developer articats and platforms like Github have evolved to a complete tech ecosystem. I don't want to write just another git manual, there is plenty out there. Checkout some places to learn about the basic lifecycle, this is enough for our purposes.\n",

        "I am not a professional developer and know Python only from occasional small coding sessions. What I see in most notebooks is some glue code or a sequence of setup steps for the technology we are going to use. So, if you have a rough understanding what coding with Python is, this won't hurt. If all goes well, you do not need to jump into the code but just have to start it - this is the beauty of Jupyter Notebooks, which can guide you through an interactive session without jumping in every tarpit.\n",
