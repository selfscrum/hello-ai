While for classic projects, a virtual machine is rather a convenience (quick setup, automated installation, secured environment etc.), it becomes a \"must\" for experiments with AI. Models, data, and processing needs grow so quick that maintaining your own setup is not feasible any longer - at least until you leave learning mode and decide to build your own AI factory ðŸ˜….\n",

So if you want to upgrade to Colab Pro or move to a more specialized provider, feel free to do so.
