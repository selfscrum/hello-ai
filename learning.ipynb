        "# Setting up a Hosting Provider\n",
        "\n",
        "If you have worked with Cloud providers, you know the setup of virtual machines. While for classic projects, a virtual machine is rather a convenience (quick setup, automated installation, secured environment etc.), it becomes a \"must\" for experiments with AI. \n",
        "\n",
        "Models, data, and processing needs grow so quick that maintaining your own setup is not feasible any longer - at least until you leave learning mode and decide to build your own AI factory 😅.\n",
        "\n",
        "For first steps, [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) is a good and easy to use option:\n",
        "* Free for initial steps.\n",
        "* Integrated with your Google Account and Drive, so you have a project store already.\n",
        "* Integrated with Github, so you can easily maintain the development of your notebooks in an orderly fashion.\n",
        "* Paid upgrades possible if you need more.\n",
        "* Local runtime of Jupyter possible if you already have resources available ([Setup Info ](https://research.google.com/colaboratory/local-runtimes.html), not yet tried).\n",
        "\n",
        "Especially in the free environment, Colab has some performance and quality issues. You will learn pretty quick about broken tasks because your (virtual) hardware is not sufficient. So if you want to move to a more specialized provider, feel free to do so. I tried some few, but are not yet able to compare them systematically since I basically used only beginner's feature sets.\n",

        "\n",
        "It's great that ChatGPT can write now software code for you, but what do you do with it? Today's tool chain maturity still requires that you integrate partial results into an end-to-end workstream. So you should at least roughly know what you are doing with the individual components.\n",
        "\n",
        "For developers this might be familiar turf to some extent, so you can quickly flip through this block. For everyone else, this chapter is not necessarily a roadblock before you can jump into AI joys, but it can't hurt to make yourself familiar with these concepts before or in parallel to the AI learning, depending how you learn best.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Git\n",
        "git is the central repository for developer articats and platforms like Github have evolved to a complete tech ecosystem. I don't want to write just another git manual, there is plenty out there. Checkout some places to learn about the basic lifecycle, this is enough for our purposes.\n",

        "\n",
        "No worries, we don't code yet. If you are on a Colab environment, let's just use a little predefined notebook integration to insert a codeblock semi-automatically. Click the folder on the left toolbar, then select the folder with the google drive symbol. **Do not** accept the access options. \n",

This means you can access all files in Google Drive from within the Notebook. You might want to use it for session results, and data and model uploads. All assets that are meant to persist the session, should be stored directly in the notebook or as files in Github.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Python\n",
        "\n",
        "I am not a professional developer and know Python only from occasional small coding sessions. What I see in most notebooks is some glue code or a sequence of setup steps for the technology we are going to use. So, if you have a rough understanding what coding with Python is, this won't hurt. If all goes well, you do not need to jump into the code but just have to start it - this is the beauty of Jupyter Notebooks, which can guide you through an interactive session without jumping in every tarpit.\n",
        "\n",
        "But if something goes wrong, you might get some error messages. It is surely beneficial if you can roughly interpret them, or check answers from Google to fix the problem.\n",

        "## Markdown\n",
        "\n",
        "You should be familiar with the markdown notation since thisis how Jupyter Notebook texts are written. You find this supported in many tools like Github, Notion, too name some. It is easy and compelling and relieves you from the \"Learn MS Word\" burden. See [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/)\n",

        "## Image manipulation\n",
        "\n",
        "If you are interested in image processing, you might need some processing tools since current AI has quite some prerequisites about image formats etc. You can use any desktop app of your choice, or you can use web services like [Birme](https://birme.net) to support your batch workflow.\n"
