        "If you have worked with Cloud providers, you know the setup of virtual machines. While for classic projects, a virtual machine is rather a convenience (quick setup, automated installation, secured environment etc.), it becomes a \"must\" for experiments with AI. Models, data, and processing needs grow so quick that maintaining your own setup is not feasible any longer - at least until you leave learning mode and decide to build your own AI factory ðŸ˜….\n",
        "\n",
        "For first steps, [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) is a good and easy to use option:\n",
        "* Free for initial steps.\n",
        "* Integrated with your Google Account and Drive, so you have a project store already.\n",
        "* Integrated with Github, so you can easily maintain the development of your notebooks in an orderly fashion.\n",

        "\n",
        "Especially in the free environment, Colab has some performance and quality issues. You will learn pretty quick about broken tasks because your (virtual) hardware is not sufficient. So if you want to move to a more specialized provider, feel free to do so. I tried some few, but are not yet able to compare them systematically since I basically used only beginner's feature sets.\n",

For everyone else, this chapter is not necessarily a roadblock before you can jump into AI joys, but it can't hurt to make yourself familiar with these concepts before or in parallel to the AI learning, depending how you learn best.\n",

        "## Python\n",
        "\n",
        "I am not a professional developer and know Python only from occasional small coding sessions. What I see in most notebooks is some glue code or a sequence of setup steps for the technology we are going to use. So, if you have a rough understanding what coding with Python is, this won't hurt. If all goes well, you do not need to jump into the code but just have to start it - this is the beauty of Jupyter Notebooks, which can guide you through an interactive session without jumping in every tarpit.\n",
